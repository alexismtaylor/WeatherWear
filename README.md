# WeatherWear
WeatherWear app is an app that uses a weather API to give the user a personalized weather experience. Upon downloading the app, the user is prompted to take pictures/upload pictures of their clothing. 
  There will be multiple clothing categories:
    For instance: T-Shirts, Shorts, Pants, Tank-tops, etc.
      (Different options for men and women)
After the user has uploaded a sufficient amount of clothing options, (5 or more per category possibly), the main app screen will load. The main app screen will feature the date and time (maybe), the weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), and the temperature currently and the temperature in 6 hours (to get a wide variety of temperatures). Based on the temperature and weather condition, the app will then select which categories are best suitable for the weather and then return a random item from 2 different categories (shorts/t-shirts, pants/long-sleeves), etc. It will then display the 2 pictures from the categories on the app screen.
